## 🎯 Why Use Nebula?

Running a home-based or independent business is challenging, especially when it comes to managing appointments and communicating with clients. Nebula was created after hearing from real business owners (E.g., Home-based lash technicians) about the time lost to manual scheduling, reminders, and admin work.

**Nebula gives you that time back.**  
Our app automates appointment scheduling, reminders, and availability management, so you can focus on delivering great service—not paperwork.
